Students’ regulation of Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE Regulations Vol. II. 74/C. § ) states 
that as long as a student presents another student’s work - or at least the significant part of it - 
as his/her own performance, it will count as a disciplinary fault. The most serious consequence of a 
disciplinary fault can be dismissal of the student from the University.
